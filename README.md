### 2. Configure Launch Path

After running the above commands:

- Open `start.bat` in a text editor.
- Replace the default path `E:\1` with your **own local project path** (e.g., `D:\Projects\kythros`).
  
Save the file after editing.

###3. Use `launch.vbs` for Easy Starting

You have two options to start the widget:
